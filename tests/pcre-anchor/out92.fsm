# the global start or have an unanchored end loop after, because by the
# time execution gets there it has already either matched some input
# ('a') or anchored to the end -- the only matching inputs should be "",
# "\n", and "<anything>ab<anything>", but "a^", "$b", or anything else
# that does not contain "ab" must not match.
